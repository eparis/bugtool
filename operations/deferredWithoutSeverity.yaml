  comment:
    body: This bug has been set to target the 4.5.0 release without specifying a severity.
      As part of triage when determining the importance of bugs a severity should
      be specified. Since these bugs have not been properly triaged we are removing
      the target release. Teams will need to add a severity before deferring these
      bugs again.
