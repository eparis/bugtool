      This bug sets Target Release equal to a z-stream but has no bug in the 'Depends On' field. As such this is not a valid bug state and the target release is being unset.

      Any bug targeting 4.1.z must have a bug targeting 4.2 in 'Depends On.'
      Similarly, any bug targeting 4.2.z must have a bug with Target Release of 4.3 in 'Depends On.'
    is_private: true
  target_release: '---'
